# Metrics to Analyze Trees with

## Tree Analysis

### Height / Depth
- Distance from root to leaf
- Average
- Maximum

### Degree
- Number of children a node has
- Average
- Maximum

### Size 
- Total number of nodes

### Balance
- How even branches are distributed

## Filesystem Specific

### File Count / Folder Count Ratio

### File Size Distribution
- Min / Max
- Average
- Variance of file sizes

### Storage Depth Distribution
- Where files tend to live
- Shallow or deep

### Largest Subtree
- Whiuch folder has the most descendants
- Which folder has the most bytes

## Traversal and Efficiency Metrics

### Path Length
- Sum of all root to node distances

### Average Path Length
- Navigation cost

### Node density per level
- Nodes at each depth
- Good for tree shape

## Customizable Metrics

### Change node weights
- weight by file size

### Thresholds
- Flag folders deeper than N
- Flag folders bigger than M MB
