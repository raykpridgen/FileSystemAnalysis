r"""Class for rooting and unrooting of trees.

Rooting and unrooting trees turns out to be quite a bit more
complicated than you might expect. The difficult part is keeping
track of Node features that in practice are coded as attributes to
Nodes, but in reality are sometimes features of *edges*, such as
'support' or 'dist', and thus need to be re-assigned when an parent
child relationships change.

Re-rooting a rooted tree:
               o                            x
              / \                          / \
             1   2         root('n')      n   u
                / \          -->             / \
               .   u                        2   .
                  / \                      / \
                 .   n                    1   .

Rooting an unrooted tree:
                                            x
                                           / \
              _ 2 _        root('n')      n   u
             |  |  |         -->             / \
             1  .  u                        2   .
                  / \                      / \
                 .   n                    1   .

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree: ToyTree
        A rooted or unrooted ToyTree to (re-)root.
    *query: str, int, or Node
        One or more Node selectors, which can be Node objects, names,
        or int idx labels. If multiple are entered the MRCA node will
        be used as the base of the edge to split.
    root_dist: None or float
        The length (dist) along the root edge above the Node query
        where the new root edge should be placed. Default is None
        which will place root at the midpoint of the edge. A float
        can be entered, but will raise ToyTreeError if > len of edge.
    edge_features: Sequence[str]
        One or more Node features that should be treated as a feature
        of its edge, not the Node itself. On rooting, edge features
        are re-polarized, to apply to the correct Node. The 'dist'
        and 'support' features are always treated as edge features.
        Add additional edge features here. See docs for example.
    inplace: bool
        If True the original tree is modified and returned, otherwise
        a modified copy is returned.
